# Grass-Game-Framework
A superannuated, 2D platformer game framework developed in C and legacy OpenGL. For learning purposes in algorithms and coding practice.

The framework houses several functions that open an OpenGL window, draws radial polygons and rectangles, computes physics and math algorithms, manages the camera, data values and the artificial intelligence algorithms. The framework calls initGameData(), readInput(), and runGameScript() functions that are housed in an external file and are written by a user in a functional style script. initGameData() is called once to load all the necessary data, readInput() defines keyboard inputs and their effects, and runGameScript() is the general logic for the user's game or simulation.
