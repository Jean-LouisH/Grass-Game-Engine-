		<h2>Game & Simulation Development Manual</h2>
	

		<p>The Suprannua Engine plainly uses regular 2D polygons and blocks to represent game entities or agents of physical or algorithmic simulations. It doesn't use a development suite, nor does it offer a flexible means of integrating newer core componentry to make it into anything but a superannuated 2D canvas.</p>

		<p>You don't need to edit the Engine files to write a simple game or simulation using the Suprannua Engine, but you can if you have modifications in mind. Neither do you need to know the Engine inside out.</p>

		<p>What you do need to know is;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Very basic C/C++</li>
			<li>Suprannua's game objects.</li>
			<li>Suprannua's functions.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The Suprannua Engine acts as a framework where you can edit game object data, as rigidly defined by the Engine, using almost nothing but functions. Depending on the game, most of the functions can be called in a simple sequence, but knowledge of C (at the very least) is needed for situations where you might want to loop functions (e.g. causing multiple polygons to fall under gravity) and test for logical conditions (checking whether the player has past a checkpoint).</p>
