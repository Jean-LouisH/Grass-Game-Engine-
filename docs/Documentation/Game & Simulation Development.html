		<h2>Game & Simulation Development Manual</h2>
	

		<p>The Suprannua Engine plainly uses regular 2D polygons and blocks to represent game entities or agents of physical or algorithmic simulations. It doesn't use a development suite, nor does it offer a flexible means of integrating newer core componentry to make it into anything but a superannuated 2D canvas.</p>

		<p>You don't need to edit the Engine files to write a simple game or simulation using the Suprannua Engine, but you can if you have modifications in mind. Neither do you need to know the Engine inside out.</p>

		<p>What you do need to know is;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Very basic C/C++</li>
			<li>Suprannua's game objects.</li>
			<li>Suprannua's functions.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The Suprannua Engine acts as a framework where you can edit game object data, as rigidly defined by the Engine, using almost nothing but functions. Depending on the game, most of the functions can be called in a simple sequence, but knowledge of C (at the very least) is needed for situations where you might want to loop functions (e.g. causing multiple polygons to fall under gravity) and test for logical conditions (checking whether the player has past a checkpoint).</p>
		
		<h2>Game Objects</h2>
		
		<p>The game objects are Polygons, Blocks, Texts and the Camera. All game objects are instances of type defined structs with other structs and variables inside. They all contain the Vertex struct to represent x and y positions against a world map. The world map and rectangular objects like the Camera and Blocks all contain the Rect struct to represent width and height. </p>

		<p>Polygons and Blocks are the only objects that contain the Properties struct, which describes the object's;</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Classification (Whether it is a background, entity, etc)</li>
			<li>Colour (Including alpha)</li>
			<li>Edges (Geometric sides)</li>
			<li>Angle (Only really applicable to Polygons)</li>
			<li>BouncePercentage (Elasticity)</li>
			<li>Mass</li>
			<li>xVelocity</li>
			<li>yVelocity</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Text is different where in addition to position, it stores a string with colour and either a entity or heads up display classification (to pin to the camera or world).</p>
		
		<h2>Game Functions</h2>
		
		<p>Suprannua's game objects can be editted by assigning values to their member variables, but usually this is never required. To make data editting even easier and to avoid reinventing the wheel, there is a collection of functions that perform the usual physical, scripting   </p>
